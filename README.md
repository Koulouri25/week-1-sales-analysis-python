# Week 1 – Sales Data Analysis (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involved cleaning and analyzing a sales dataset using Python. I explored the data, generated visualizations, and shared final business insights related to sales across three product categories.

## 🧰 Tools & Skills Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Business Insight Writing

## 🔧 Steps I Took
- Cleaned the dataset: handled missing values, renamed columns, corrected data types
- Performed grouping and aggregation to find total sales by category
- Built a bar chart to visualize total sales for Electronics, Books, and Clothing

## 💡 Final Insights
- **Electronics** had the highest total sales overall, suggesting strong demand in this category.
- **Books** and **Clothing** had significantly lower sales, which could reflect lower pricing, less frequent promotions, or lower stock.
- To increase revenue, the business could consider targeted promotions or seasonal strategies for underperforming categories.

## 📁 Files Included
– 'sales.py' - Python script for cleaning and analysis
