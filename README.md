# Week 1 – Sales Data Analysis (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involved cleaning and analyzing a sales dataset using Python. I explored the data, generated visualizations, and shared final business insights.

## 🧰 Tools & Skills Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization
- Business Insight Writing

## 🔧 Steps I Took
- Cleaned the dataset: handled missing values, renamed columns, corrected data types
- Performed grouping and aggregation to find total sales by category
- Built a bar chart to visualize total sales per category

## 📊 Key Visualization
*(Insert chart here later — or skip this line if you don’t have it yet)*

## 💡 Final Insights
- The category with the highest sales was **[insert category here]**.
- Categories **[A]** and **[B]** had noticeably lower sales — possibly due to seasonality or low inventory.
- The store could benefit from focusing promotions on underperforming categories.

## 📁 Files Included
- `sales_analysis.py` – Python script for cleaning and analysis
- `sales_data.csv` – Raw or cleaned sales dataset (optional)
- `sales_by_category.png` – Chart (optional)

## 👩‍💻 About Me
